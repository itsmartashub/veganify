# Veganify
Veganify is a web application to discover and save vegetarian dishes and smoothie recipes using the **Spoonacular API**. </br>
Previously designed in **Adobe Xd**, Veganify is built using the **Nuxt.js** framework. </br>
This is my first experience with **Nuxt**, **SSR**, and the incredible **Vercel** deploying platform.
