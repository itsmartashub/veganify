# Nuxt.js Learning Project (2022)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The first loading is painfully slow because Veganify uses around `20` different `API` keys to avoid exceeding Spoonacular API rate limits. This was a necessary workaround at the time and isn't optimized. <br>
> Performance was not a priority since the sole purpose of this project was **learning** and **experimentation**.

## Veganify
Veganify is a web application to discover and save vegetarian dishes and smoothie recipes using the **Spoonacular API**. </br>
Previously designed in **Adobe Xd**, Veganify is built using the **Nuxt.js** framework. </br>
This is my first experience with **Nuxt**, **SSR**, and the incredible **Vercel** deploying platform.

This project was my first encounter with Nuxt.js, back in 2022. It was a fun yet challenging experiment to explore the framework and learn the basics of building a Nuxt.js application.
