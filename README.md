# Nuxt.js Learning Project (2022)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The first loading is painfully slow because Veganify integrates `20` separate `Spoonacular API` keys for the same service to avoid hitting usage caps. Yes, it’s as clunky as it sounds. This was a necessary workaround at the time and isn't optimized. <br>
> Performance was not a priority since the sole purpose of this project was **learning** and **experimentation**. And that being said, there's no plans for speed improvement.

## Veganify
Veganify is a web application to discover and save vegetarian dishes and smoothie recipes using the **Spoonacular API**. </br>
Previously designed in **Adobe Xd**, Veganify is built using the **Nuxt.js** framework. </br>
This is my first experience with **Nuxt**, **SSR**, and the incredible **Vercel** deploying platform.

This project is a snapshot of my learning journey in 2022. While it’s not practical or performant, it represents an important milestone for me as a developer. It was a fun yet challenging experiment to explore the framework and learn the basics of building a Nuxt.js application. I hope it inspires others to keep experimenting and learning, no matter how messy the first steps may be.
